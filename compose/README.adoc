= Docker Compose Setup for Local Development
:description: Instructions for running the Litter application locally using Docker Compose
:keywords: docker, compose, mongodb, development, deployment, local
:toc: preamble
:source-highlighter: rouge

[.lead]
This directory contains Docker Compose configurations for running the Litter application locally.
While suitable for development and testing, consider the link:../terraform/README.adoc[Terraform-based Kubernetes deployment] for staging and production environments.

[IMPORTANT]
.Prerequisites
====
[.prerequisites]
* [x] Unix-based terminal (Linux, macOS, WSL, etc.)
* [x] link:https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Docker] and link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[Docker Compose] installed and running
* [x] The JAR file has already been built via the Gradle wrapper and is located at `build/libs/litter.jar` (from the project root)
====

== Quick Start

=== 1. Environment Setup

Copy the example environment file and adjust the values:

[source,bash]
----
cd compose # navigate to the compose directory
cp example.env .env
vim .env # edit .env with your preferred text editor
----

[TIP]
====
You'll also need to edit the `docker-compose_build-image.yml` file to set the correct image name and tag (if using a forked repo).
====

=== 2. Choose Your Deployment Method

You have two options for running the application:

==== Option A: Build Image Locally

Uses the local `Dockerfile` to build the image:

[source,bash]
----
docker compose -f docker-compose_build-image.yml up -d
----

==== Option B: Pull Pre-built Image

Pulls the image from a container registry:

[source,bash]
----
docker compose -f docker-compose_pull-image.yml up -d
----

[TIP]
====
Option A is good for local development when making rapid changes.

Option B is better for testing a specific version or when you don't need to modify the code.
====

== Development Features

=== Remote Debugging

You can include configuration for remote debugging (usually on port 5005).
To connect your IDE:

1. Create a Remote JVM Debug configuration
2. Set the port to 5005
3. Start debugging

[TIP]
====
- `docker-compose_build-image.yml` includes the JVM remote debugging options by default.
- `docker-compose_pull-image.yml` does _not_ have this included by default.
====

=== Database Persistence

MongoDB data is persisted in a named volume (`mongodb_data`).
To start fresh, remove the volume:

[source,bash]
----
docker compose down -v
----

== Common Tasks

=== Viewing Logs

[source,bash]
----
# all containers
docker compose logs -f

# specific container
docker compose logs -f litter-app
----

=== Stopping the Application

[source,bash]
----
docker compose down
----

=== Rebuilding After Changes

[source,bash]
----
docker compose -f docker-compose_build-image.yml up -d --build
----

[WARNING]
====
Remember that Compose is primarily for development.
For production deployments, I'd recommend the link:../terraform/README.adoc[Terraform configuration] to deploy to Kubernetes.
====

== Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Ensure all ports (8080, 27017, 5005) are available
2. Check your `.env` file for correct values
3. Verify Docker has sufficient resources
4. Use `docker compose logs` to investigate errors

[CAUTION]
====
Do not commit your `.env` file to version control!
In production (e.g. using the Terraform setup), you'll use Azure Key Vault or similar for secrets.
