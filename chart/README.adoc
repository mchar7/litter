= Helm Chart for Litter
:description: Kubernetes application manifests for the Litter app and MongoDB deployment using Helm
:keywords: helm, kubernetes, mongodb, deployment
:toc: preamble
:toc-title: Contents
:source-highlighter: rouge

[.lead]
This chart provides the Kubernetes application manifests for the Litter app and a MongoDB instance.
It doesn't manage all the peripheral details (like PVC creation, certificates, or DNS), however.
I'd recommend using the Terraform setup in this repository to handle the entire end-to-end infrastructure.

[IMPORTANT]
.Prerequisites
====
[.prerequisites]
* [x] Unix-based terminal (Linux, macOS, WSL, etc.)
* [x] Helm link:https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[installed] and configured on your local machine
* [x] Cluster running and configured with:
** A valid StorageClass (and PVC already created if you need MongoDB data persistence)
** Certificate management (if you require HTTPS) and ingress setup (this chart assumes 'nginx-ingress' is on the cluster)
** Any other dependencies your environment might require
====

== Instructions

=== 1. Usage

* You'll need to adjust the environment overrides in the `values.common.yaml` file, as well as the override file for the environment you'll be deploying to (e.g., `values.dev.yaml`, `values.staging.yaml`, `values.prod.yaml`).
* You'll need to set overrides for the app's image repository and tag (they are left blank in the common values file as they are usually overridden during the automated CI/CD workflow).

.Example command
[%collapsible]
[source,bash]
----
helm install litter ./chart \
  --namespace your-namespace \
  --create-namespace \
  -f ./chart/values.common.yaml \
  -f ./chart/values.dev.yaml \
  --set app.image.repository=<your-repo> \
  --set app.image.tag="latest" # or a specific tag
----

[NOTE]
====
If you set custom resource requests/limits or environment variables, place them in your override YAML.
The required secrets (e.g., for MongoDB URI and the JWT secret) should already be available in the target namespace.
====

=== 2. Configuration

The main configuration is in:

* *values.common.yaml*: Shared default values used across all environments.
* *values.<env>.yaml*: Environment-specific overrides (e.g., dev vs. staging vs. prod).

[TIP]
====
If you don't need separate environments, you can just stick to `values.common.yaml` and pass in minimal overrides.
But I find these environment overrides to be a good way to keep things organized.
====

== Recommended Approach

[CAUTION]
====
Manually deploying this chart bypasses automatic certificate generation, ingress constructs, persistent volumes, and DNS management.
You'll be on your own for these parts of the puzzle.
====

*The preferred (_and simpler_) route* is to use the Terraform IaC approach, which automates the entire environmentâ€”AKS, Key Vault, certificate provisioning, DNS, and more.
If you have real production needs (or just want fewer headaches), see the link:../terraform/README.adoc[Terraform README].

== That's it!

If you run into trouble:

1. Check your environment overrides.
Make sure values for `app.image.repository`/`tag` are correct.
2. Confirm your secrets (like `mongo-uri`) exist in the cluster's Key Vault references or are manually defined in a secret.
3. For DNS/cert or PVC/Storage issues, see the link:../terraform/README.adoc[Terraform section] or open an issue in this repository.

[WARNING]
====
This chart won't magically handle cluster-level configurations.
If you add or remove stuff manually, keep track of it.
